**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Node.js

**Dependencies used:** bcrypt, cloudinary, connect-mongo, dotenv, ejs, express, express-flash, express-session, mongodb, mongoose, morgan, nodemon, passport, passport-local, validator

## Optimizations

The final product will provide the ability for users to research fruits based on a variety of search functions, create an account to save specific fruits or categories, and submit additions to the collection. 

Planned optimizations: 
1. Update post categories to include a more detailed breakdown of the fruit and its properties. (updating schemas)
2. Look into providing more user friendly settings, such as changing a password, updating personal information, adding a profile image, etc. 
3. Update index to include a search function so users are not required to make an account to access the database.
4. Update user profiles with the ability to create lists and save specific posts to their chosen list. 
5. Update user profile with ability to add personalized experience for each fruit (tastes, where it was obtained, etc.).
